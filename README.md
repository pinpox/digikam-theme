![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b1e3e87-15f9-4a04-9697-3c0a95387973)

[digikam](https://www.digikam.org/) allows exporting albums as HTML galleries. 
You can add your custem themes, but putting them into `.local/share/digikam/themes/`. 
See the digikam [manual section](https://docs.digikam.org/fr/post_processing/html_gallery.html) for details on theme creation.

The theme is inspired by 2000s tumblr blogs.
